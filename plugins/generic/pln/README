About
-----
This plugin provides a means for OJS to preserve content on a private LOCKSS
network. The plugin checks for new and modified content and provided the PLN's
terms of use are met, will communicate with the PLN's staging server to preserve
your published content automatically.

License
-------
This plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2. See the
accompanying OJS file docs/COPYING for the complete terms of this license.

System Requirements
-------------------
OJS 2.4.5 or greater.
PHP 5.2 or greater.
CURL support for PHP.
ZipArchive support for PHP.

Note
----
The primary difference between this plugin and the existing LOCKSS preservation
mechanism present in OJS is the PLN requires no registration or involvement with
the network - as long as you agree with the network's terms of use, you can
preserve your journal's content.
