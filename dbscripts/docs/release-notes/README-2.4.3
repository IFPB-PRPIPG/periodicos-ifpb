OJS 2.4.3 Release Notes
GIT tag: ojs-2_4_3-0
Release date: December 6, 2013
==============================

NOTE: Users who have configured a cron job for their journal should be aware
that upgrading to OJS 2.4.3 will automatically enable the acron plugin, which
is a cron alternative that occasionally processes scheduled tasks using regular
web requests as the trigger. If you are using cron, you should disable the
acron plugin and setup a cron job to process statistics from log files. See
pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=PKP_Statistics_Framework
